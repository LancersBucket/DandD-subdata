<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
When you reach 4th Level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you canâ€™t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<br><br>

<h2>Timeless Body</h2>
Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.<br><br>

<h2>Beast Spells</h2>
Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your Druid Spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal Components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material Components.<br><br>

<h2>Archdruid</h2>
At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.<br><br>

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic Components of your Druid Spells, as well as any material Components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.
